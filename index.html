            <p>About Me</p>
            <p>Entry Level Software Engineer</p>
            <p>Hello, My name is Karina Sanchez. 
                I am a student at Southern New Hampshire University and a Business Analyst for PennyMac Loan Services. 
                I am currently majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering.
                I hope to use my major to bring out my creative side, skills, and passions to create long lasting technology that can change the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am originally from El Paso, Texas, a place where everyone is incredibly nice, respectful, and very hardworking.
                I am the youngest of 2 kids. My sister is happily married and gave me the gift of being an aunt to one niece and two nephews. 
                They are adorable! (I hope to have my own some day.)
                I am beyond grateful for my family, friends, and even my employer. 
                I've learned a lot about being respectful, ethical, accountable, reliable, a team-player and to be passionate about my dreams.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will be graduating with my Bachelors in Computer Science this Summer! (Thank God!) I am beyond thrilled!
                There have been many ups and downs along this journey, but I have gained many additional skills that make it all worth it.
                I went from knowing absolutely nothing about computers, 
                to learning about its hardware and software, learning the different programming languages, the different algorithms,
                the databases, and I even had a blast learning embedded systems with a Raspberry Pi.
                It's been such an incredible journey. I've learned and grown so much and I have so much gratitude for everyone who has been here to support me.
            </p>
            <p>
                My overall goal is to complete my degree, broaden and strengthen my mind, thinking skills, and capabilities, 
                master web design and development, learn additional frameworks, and keep striving to become better each day.
            </p>
